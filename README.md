# VerifIText 🧠

**AI vs Human Content Classifier**

---

##  About

In a world where AI is becoming a common writing partner, it’s easy to wonder, who really wrote this? That’s exactly why I built VerifIText. It’s a smart little tool that helps you figure out if a piece of text was written by a human or generated by AI.

Using some cool language tricks and machine learning magic, VerifIText looks at things like how many words are used, how sentences flow, and how diverse the vocabulary is — then gives you a quick, easy-to-understand answer.

Whether you’re a writer wanting to check your content’s originality, an editor curious about the source, or just someone fascinated by AI, VerifIText makes it simple and fun to uncover the story behind the text. And because it’s built with Streamlit, you can use it right in your browser — no tech headaches, just paste your text and go!
